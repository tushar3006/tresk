Yumist card Cart Module:
--using AngularJs
--tested on mozilla firefox


Every new card can add items through the add item button where customer can see the selected item and the quantity associated with it

After entering the locality preferences,
address and comments regarding the underlying order the customer can place order to the 
card holder which :

1. Initially is a set of three holders with last three successful/completed orders of the customer for reference or repetition.

2. If an order is repeated status changes from completed to pending and can be treated as a new order with current order date being updated in the order details.

3. when order statuses are pending then a fourth or more cards will be generated and shown else the cardholder will contain only three cards at a time   

4.on pressing confirm the data can be sent to corresponding json/database files using back end api's.


*******Some minor bug fixes might be there due to hasty preparation but as whole module works good.
 Defect tracker:
 quantity doesnt show when two items have same quantity.

above bugs can be fixed in some given time.


rest it is "Easy to use and understand".
Necessary comments have been made in the respective files.
